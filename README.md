# ADSA_SD
ADSA_SD is an optical surface tension measurement tool for Sessile Droplet (PD). The code gets a drop image and physical properties as an input and detecs edge coordinates of a drop, solves the laplace equation numerically and optimizes the laplace solution until it fits the experimental drop profile and gives output of surface tension value.
